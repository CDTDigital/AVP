###c.   Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process;  
###d.   Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools;

###s.   Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; and 
###t.    Prototype  and  underlying  platforms  used  to  create  and  run  the  prototype  are  openly  licensed and free of charge.
