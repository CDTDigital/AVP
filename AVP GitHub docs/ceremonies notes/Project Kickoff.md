j. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype;
The iterative development approach for this prototype uses the Agile/Scrum methodology guided by our resident Agile Coach (Hiren)
1. Prior to begining the agile/scrum process, the team setup the facilities including the collaborative work-area, gathered supplies, selected the tools, configured the architecture, and identified each sprint goal
2. Set up team collaboration site in tree.taiga.io [Evidence?] with the product backlog used to guide team
3. At the beginning of each sprint, we identified the sprint backlog, held a sprint planning meeting using Agile Planning Poker 
4. Held daily scrum meetings at the same time and place with visibility of the Kanban task board
5. Team co-location with visible persona's with clearly identified roles and goals
6. Sprint Demo for review and to gather feedback from Product Owner and proxy users based on personas
7. Sprint Retrospectives to help course correct the process
