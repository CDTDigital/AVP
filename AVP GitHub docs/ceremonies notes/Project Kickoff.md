#The Kick-off Meeting  

The project kick off meeting included brining the entire team together to identify the goals of the project and to disucss the overall timeline.  
The iterative development approach for this prototype uses the Agile/Scrum methodology guided by our resident Agile Coach (Hiren)  
1. the team setup the facilities including the collaborative work-area,  
2. gathered supplies,  
3. selected the tools,   
4. configured the architecture, and 
5. identified each sprint goal  

This information was shared with the team during the kick-off meeting with the Product Ownwer.  

The first task after the project kickoff was to idenfiy the product backlog.
