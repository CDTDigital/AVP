#Sprint 0 Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is a meeting facilitated by the ScrumMaster at which the team discusses the just-concluded sprint and determines what could be changed that might make the next sprint more productive (See reference below).

We used the team accessible trello to document our retrospective.
