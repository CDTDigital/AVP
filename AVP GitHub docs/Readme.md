##One key User Centric Design Approach - Personas  
Personas are "hypothetical archetypes" of actual users. They are not real people, but they represent real people during the design process. [1] A persona is a fictional characterization of a user. Our project team developed the following [User Personas](UserPersonas2.0.pdf) to be able to help guide the project.
