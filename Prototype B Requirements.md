#Prototype B Requirements   
 
##The working prototype will be an application that will allow California residents to

### establish profile and  
### manage their profile  and  

### receive emergency and non-emergency  notifications  via  
#### email, 
#### Short Message Service (SMS), 
#### and/or push notification based on the location and contact  information  provided  in  their  profile  
#### and/or  the  geo-location  of  their  cellphone  if they  have  opted  in  for  this  service.  

##In  addition,  the  working  prototype  will  provide  the 
### authorized administrative  users  with  the  ability  to  
#### publish  notifications  and  
#### track,  and  
#### analyze  and  
#### visualize  related  data.  

##The  working  prototype  
### does  not  need  to  implement any  authentication  or  
### authorization  against  an  external  directory  or  authentication  mechanism.

## Secondly is the how we have to do it. The things that should be noted is 
### the need for an Agile approach and 
### a heavy use of Open Source technologies
